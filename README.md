# Risk Of Rain 2 Skill Swapper
Ever want to play the Artificer or Engineer with a movement skill, or ever want to play Mercenary with only Eviscerate? Now you can!
Swap out survivor's skills. Works in multiplayer.

Now with (a select few) monster skills!

# Installation
1. Install [BenInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/)
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/releases)
3. Extract the zip, and copy the skill-swapper folder to your BepInEx/plugins folder

# Usage
* A list of skill and survivor names can be found [here](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/wiki)
1. Go to the character selection screen
2. Type "/swap character-name slotNumber skillName" into the chat window
    * E.g. "/swap Merc 0 Evis"
      * Swaps the Mercenary's Laser Sword with Eviserate
    * E.g. "/swap Commando 3 Blink"
      * Swaps the Commando's Roll with the Huntress's Blink
3. Repeat

## Note
Some skills don't work (e.g. Mercenary skills) on other survivors. See [Skills](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/wiki/Skills) for a full list

# Multiplayer
**You don't need to be host** but skills will only be swapped for the person using the mod (even if they use the same survivor).
If others want to swap their own skills, they need to install the mod.
