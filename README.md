# Risk Of Rain 2 Skill Swapper
Ever want to play the Artificer or Engineer with a movement skill, or ever want to play Mercenary with only Eviscerate? Now you can!
Swap out survivor's skills. Works in multiplayer.

# Installation
1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/)
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/releases) and netstandard.dll
3. Extract the zip, and move the folder to your Mods folder
4. Replace the netstandard.dll in /Risk of Rain 2/Risk of Rain 2_Data/Managed with the downloaded copy

# Usage
* A list of skill and survivor names can be found [here](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/wiki)
1. Go to the character selection screen
2. Type "/swap character-name slotNumber skillName" into the chat window
    * E.g. "/swap Merc 0 Evis"
      * Swaps the Mercenary's Laser Sword with Eviserate
    * E.g. "/swap Commando 3 Blink"
      * Swaps the Commando's Roll with the Huntress's Blink
3. Repeat

## Note
Some skills don't work (e.g. Mercenary skills) on other survivors. See [Skills](https://github.com/twofacejester/RoR2SkillSwapper/wiki/Skills) for a full list

# Multiplayer
**You don't need to be host** but skills will only be swapped for the person using the mod (even if they use the same survivor).
If others want to swap their own skills, they need to install the mod.
